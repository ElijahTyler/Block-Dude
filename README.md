# Block Dude

This is a game with blocks. And dudes. Actually, there's only one dude. Oh yeah, and for you door fans out there (shoutout Matt and Jacob), we got doors in this game. Eleven of them. Yeah. I can see your jaw scraping the floor through this README file. This game is pretty kickin'.

## Controls

### ARROW KEYS
- left : moves one block left
- right : moves one block right :o
- up : jumps up one step in front of dude
- down : picks up a box right in front of dude

You can only jump up one unit. If you try and pick up a box that has another box on top of it, I will receive an email with your IP address.

### MORE KEYS
- r : restarts the current level
- s : saves the current position
- l : loads the saved position
- ~~tab : view entire map~~ UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Note: if you try loading a saved game before you've even saved once, the dude will be brutally murdered by my code. Do you want that for the dude? Of course you don't. Nobody wants that. Don't load without saving first.

### LESS KEYS
